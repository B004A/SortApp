This application visualizes the Quick Sort and Merge Sort algorithms.

Features:
- Algorithm selection: Choose between Quick Sort and Merge Sort.
- Speed control: Adjust the visualization speed, which also affects the sorting speed.
- Pause & Resume: Pause the sorting process and resume it at any time.
- Dynamic speed adjustment: You can change the speed while the algorithm is paused and resume sorting with the new speed. However, modifying the numbers or switching the algorithm will reset the sorting progress.
